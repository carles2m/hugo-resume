<p>Having a website that can be used by everyone is no simple task. If not designed correctly, using a website can become a disgusting and frustrating experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Have you ever had to zoom on a website with your phone? Pressed the wrong link with your finger? Did annoying elements get in the middle of the screen?</li>
  <li>Do you know what a website "looks" like to a blind person? Are you certain that person will be able to use it correctly? What about people with other disabilities?</li>
  <li>Does your website look correctly in all languages? What about right-to-left languages? And in languages where long sentences have almost no spaces?</li>
  <li>Waited too long to load a website? To navigate between pages? Websites being slow specially during holidays?</li>
  <li>Have you experimented with different designs to determine which one users like the most? Ever wondered if tweaking some things will improve your conversion rate?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking for someone that has experience solving these and other topics in a company like Microsoft, you have found the right person.</p>
